## ZombieGame

<h3 align="left">Overview</h3>
<p align="left">During my third year at University I took an Advanced Game Development Module. 
The main assignment of the module was to create a game using a game engine of my choice, due to having previous experience with Unity, I found this to be the best option. 
I decided to create a 3D game inspired by Call of Duty Zombies. I went with a low poly style, creating all the environment and assets myself mainly using blender.
Overall I scored 86%.
